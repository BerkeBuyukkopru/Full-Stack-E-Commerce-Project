B&B Store is a full stack B2C e-commerce application built with React, .NET 9, MongoDB, and Iyzico sandbox payments. The platform includes a customer-facing storefront, product catalog, cart and checkout flow, user profile area, reviews, content management, and an admin dashboard for managing products, orders, coupons, cargo companies, blog content, sliders, site settings, users, and messages.

The project focuses on a realistic e-commerce flow rather than a static demo: product stock is validated on the server, discounts are recalculated by the API, cargo fees are resolved from the database, checkout is protected by authentication, and sensitive credentials are kept outside the repository.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frontend | React 19, Vite | Single-page storefront and admin UI |
| Routing | React Router | Client-side routing |
| UI | Ant Design, CSS | Forms, tables, layout, and custom styling |
| Backend | ASP.NET Core / .NET 9 | REST API and application logic |
| Database | MongoDB | Product, user, order, review, and CMS data |
| Authentication | JWT + HTTP-only cookie | Authenticated user and admin access |
| Payment | Iyzico Sandbox | Checkout form and payment callback flow |
| Security | BCrypt, HtmlSanitizer | Password hashing and stored HTML sanitization |

---

## Architecture

The backend follows a pragmatic layered structure:

- `Controllers`: HTTP endpoints for authentication, products, orders, payments, content, and admin operations.
- `Dtos`: Request and response shapes used between the API and client.
- `Models`: MongoDB document models.
- `Repositories`: Data access layer built on the MongoDB driver.
- `Services`: Reusable business services such as JWT token generation, HTML sanitization, and order expiration handling.

The frontend is organized around pages, reusable components, and React Context providers for shared state such as authentication, cart, favorites, and site settings.

Generated folders such as `API/bin`, `API/obj`, `Client/node_modules`, and `Client/dist` are intentionally excluded from version control.

---

## Security Highlights

- Sensitive values are not stored in `appsettings.json`.
- MongoDB, JWT, and Iyzico credentials should be provided through .NET user-secrets, environment variables, or a secure secret store.
- Password hashes are excluded from API responses.
- Admin-only operations are protected with role-based authorization.
- Payment checkout validates price, stock, coupon, address, and cargo information on the server.
- Cargo fees are calculated from the selected cargo company in the database, not trusted from the client payload.
- Stored HTML content is sanitized before saving to reduce XSS risk.
- Generated files such as `bin`, `obj`, `dist`, and `node_modules` are ignored.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `20.19+` or `22.12+` for Vite 7
- MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance
- Iyzico sandbox account for payment testing

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BerkeBuyukkopru/BB-Store-Full-Stack-E-Commerce.git
cd BB-Store-Full-Stack-E-Commerce
```

### 2. Configure the API Secrets

The repository intentionally keeps secret values empty. These values are required for the API to connect to MongoDB, create JWT tokens, and initialize Iyzico sandbox payments. Configure your local secrets with your own values:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "DatabaseSettings:ConnectionString" "YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "IyzicoSettings:ApiKey" "YOUR_IYZICO_SANDBOX_API_KEY" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "IyzicoSettings:SecretKey" "YOUR_IYZICO_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "JwtSettings:Secret" "YOUR_LONG_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET" --project API/API.csproj
```

Optional local values:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "IyzicoSettings:CallbackUrl" "http://localhost:5020/api/payment/callback" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "ClientSettings:BaseUrl" "http://localhost:5173" --project API/API.csproj
```

Optional first admin seed values:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminSeed:Email" "admin@example.com" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminSeed:Password" "StrongPassword123!" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminSeed:Name" "Admin" --project API/API.csproj
dotnet user-secrets set "AdminSeed:Surname" "User" --project API/API.csproj
```

### 3. Configure the Client

Create a `Client/.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5020/api
```

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd Client
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Backend

If your terminal is still inside the `Client` folder, go back to the repository root first:

```bash
cd ..
```

Then start the API:

```bash
dotnet run --project API/API.csproj
```

The API runs on:

```text
http://localhost:5020
```

### 6. Run the Frontend

In another terminal, go to the client folder and start Vite:

```bash
cd Client
npm run dev
```

The client runs on:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Initial Data and Admin Access

The repository does not include production credentials or a pre-seeded MongoDB database. When you run the project with a fresh database, MongoDB collections are created as the application writes data.

To use the admin dashboard locally:

1. Configure `AdminSeed:Email` and `AdminSeed:Password` with .NET user-secrets.
2. Start the API.
3. If no admin user exists, the API creates the first admin account automatically.
4. Start the client, log in with the seeded admin account, and open `/admin`.

The admin seed only runs when there is no existing admin user. If an account already exists with the configured admin email, that user is promoted to `admin` and its password is refreshed from `AdminSeed:Password`. If an admin already exists, the seed process is skipped.

After admin access is ready, catalog data can be created from the admin panel: categories, products, coupons, cargo companies, sliders, site settings, blog posts, and other content. A fresh database starts without catalog content until you create it from the admin dashboard.

---

## Configuration

`API/appsettings.json` contains only non-secret defaults:

```json
{
  "DatabaseSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "",
    "DatabaseName": "e-commerce"
  },
  "IyzicoSettings": {
    "ApiKey": "",
    "SecretKey": "",
    "BaseUrl": "https://sandbox-api.iyzipay.com",
    "CallbackUrl": "http://localhost:5020/api/payment/callback"
  },
  "ClientSettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:5173"
  },
  "AdminSeed": {
    "Email": "",
    "Password": "",
    "Name": "Admin",
    "Surname": "User"
  }
}
```

Use your own MongoDB database and Iyzico sandbox credentials when running the project locally.

> Payment flow uses Iyzico Sandbox. Use sandbox API credentials and Iyzico test cards only. Make sure `IyzicoSettings:CallbackUrl` points to your running API URL.

---

## Available Scripts

### Frontend

```bash
cd Client
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run preview
```

### Backend

```bash
dotnet build API/API.csproj
dotnet run --project API/API.csproj
```

---

## Validation

The project was validated with:

```bash
dotnet build API/API.csproj
cd Client
npm run lint -- --quiet
npm run build
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

Current notes:

- The frontend production build may warn about large chunks. This does not block the build, but route-level code splitting can be added later for better performance.
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` passes for moderate and higher severity issues. A low severity advisory may remain through the rich text editor dependency chain.
